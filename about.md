Hello! My name is Yuliya and I’ve had a passion for photography ever since I was a child. 

When I was in school, I’ve studied photography as one of my main classes and I’ve learned the basic techniques in Photoshop. After learning more and more about photography, I’ve realized that I want to meet new people and help people by creating a memory of their special moments. I can do any type of photoshoot a person can think of: maternity, engagement, friends, family, wedding, etc. I also do photoshoots anywhere in Washington DC, Maryland, or Virginia.
Since 2013 I’ve done different types of photoshoots: maternity, family, wedding, friends, and engagement. 

I’m very passionate when it comes to photography, I love thinking about a place where a photoshoot would be, I love thinking about how would I take photographs of people and with which type of an equipment. In addition, I love brainstorming ideas with clients, especially if a client does not have any ideas in his mind.
