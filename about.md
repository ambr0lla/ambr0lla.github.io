<br/>My name is Yuliya and Iâ€™ve had a passion for photography ever since I was a child. 

My passion for photography began in high school. All four years in high school, I worked with black and white film photography. Dark room was the place where all of my friends could find me. I found it peaceful working on developing photographs.
During my first year of college, I was in college newspaper as a photographer and took photographs of the main events. 
After the first year in college, I realized that I want to meet new people and help people by creating a memory of their special moments. I can do any type of photoshoot a person can think of: maternity, engagement, friends, family, wedding, etc. I also do photoshoots anywhere in Washington DC, Maryland, or Virginia.
