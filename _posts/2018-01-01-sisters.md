It was early January. It was cold, around 30 degrees Fahrenheit. But there were some brave people who decided not to cancel an early morning photoshoot in DC. Those people were three sisters. It was a fun photoshoot and hopefully the photographs! Here are some of the photographs that I sent to girls. I loved being their photographer!
