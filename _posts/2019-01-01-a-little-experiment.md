I was contacted by a makeup artist asking if I want to take a photo of her work. I replied that, yes, I would love to. In the end, it was one of my favorite photoshoots. I loved every part of it. Also, I loved her work. Since I don’t normally do these kinds of photoshoots, this is called “an experiment”.
