#### Other options
You can also add an album, printed photographs, scrapbook, or a canvas for additional price. All prices vary and the range is from $150 to $500. For each client, there will be a custom design.
Also, if you want to retouch additional photographs, each photo will cost $5. 
In addition, I work with many people. You can also hire for a photoshoot: 
- Makeup artist - from $100 per hour 
- Videographer - from $200 per hour
- Studio rental - from $40 per hour

> For each photoshoot you need to make a minimum deposit of $50 (depending on a type of a photoshoot) at least two weeks in advance to secure your spot. If you need a photoshoot less than two weeks, then use [contact me form]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link contact.md %}#contact) but prices or deposit might be subject to change.
